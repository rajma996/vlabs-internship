** Weekly  Summary
   + There can be many limitations in the requirements specified by the client.
   + New questions can come up when formalizing the requirements .
   + What is my footprint in the realization of the project?
   + Test cases are important . Try writing the test cases first and then the
     class/method
   + Make files can do awesome things. I really liked the systematic method of
     putting everything under one org file and the make file doing everything
     else of dividing in different folder and test cases. Kudos to who thought
     this.
