* Broad Idea 
** Server-Client    

   Web application is a client server model, where client sends a request in
   some format which is processed by the server and the answer is sent
   back. The server has a database with it which is the main essence of the
   server. All the requests are answered based on the content in the
   database. The request may also be a request to edit the database.

* Flow of a request
** 
   The client sends a request in form of some link or buttons on the browser
   which is converted to appropriate format and sent to the client .
   The client then interprets the request and based on the content of the
   database answers, the response is then interpreted again by the client and
   then appropriate response is shown on the browser

* Interfaces
** Rest API
   The rest api is the way or method in which the URL entered by the client is
   interpreted by the client.
** consistent API
   the interface between the client process and the database
** Many other interfaces also are present

* Life Cycle 
** SDLC
   The webapp never stops is a sense that constantly new requests come up to
   the client process which is responded back by the client. 
   Various steps like version control, requirement gathering, testing,
   deployment are a part of developing a webapplication
